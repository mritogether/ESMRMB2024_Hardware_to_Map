# Educational Track 2 (ET2): Reconstruction of Images and Parameter Maps

Welcome to the repository for the Workshop _Educational Track 2 (ET2): Reconstruction of Images and Parameter Maps_ at the [ESMRMB 2024](https://www.esmrmb2024.org/) in Barcelona.

> **Date and Time:** Saturday, October 5th, 2024 (11:00 â€“ 12:30)

## Description

This repository contains [exercise](https://github.com/mritogether/ESMRMB2024_Hardware_to_Map/blob/main/04_reconstruction_of_images_and_parameter_maps/notebooks/04_reconstruction_exercise.ipynb) and [solution](https://github.com/mritogether/ESMRMB2024_Hardware_to_Map/blob/main/04_reconstruction_of_images_and_parameter_maps/notebooks/04_reconstruction_solutions.ipynb) notebooks for reconstructing a T2 parameter map using a low-field MRI scanner. This workshop concludes an educational track on obtaining a parameter map: from hardware setup to sequence development, simulation, and finally reconstruction.

## Contents of this Workshop

- Image Reconstruction: Compressed Sensing, Model-Based Reconstruction, Machine Learning (Efrat Shimron)
- Introduction to the [BART Toolbox](https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/) (Martin Uecker)
- Hands-on session (Julia Pfitzer)

## Prerequisites

### Google Colab

We recommend using Google Colab to run the notebook during the course (_a Google Account and an active internet connection are required_).

You can find the notebooks in the [notebooks](https://github.com/mritogether/ESMRMB2024_Hardware_to_Map/tree/main/04_reconstruction_of_images_and_parameter_maps/notebooks) folder.

### Local

For local execution at home, the following are required:

- Python3 (with the required packages as listed in [`requirements.txt`](notebooks/requirements.txt))
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
- [BART](https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/) (latest version from the Github 'master' branch!)
- For Microsoft Windows, WSL2 is required as described [here](https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/installation_windows.html)
