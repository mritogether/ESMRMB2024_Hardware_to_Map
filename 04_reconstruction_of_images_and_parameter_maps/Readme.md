# Educational Track 2 (ET2): Reconstruction of Images and Parameter Maps

Welcome to the repository for the Workshop _Educational Track 2 (ET2): Reconstruction of Images and Parameter Maps_ at the [ESMRMB 2024](https://www.esmrmb2024.org/) in Barcelona.

> **Date and Time:** Saturday, October 5th, 2024 (11:00 â€“ 12:30)

## Description

This repository contains [exercise](...) and [solution](...) notebooks for reconstructing a T2 parameter map using a low-field MRI scanner. This workshop concludes an educational track on obtaining a parameter map: from hardware setup to sequence development, simulation, and finally reconstruction.
