## Necessary technical preparation steps
* Provided hands-on exercises and pulse sequence code snippets are in Python programming language.
* The hands-on exercises are based on running Python code in Notebooks within the Google Colab environment, therefore, no additional software is required.    
* A **Google account** and a **laptop or tablet connected to the Internet** are required to run Notebooks in Google Colab.

## Organization of this directory
This directory contains all course materials organised in sub-directories listed below:
* `data`: contains example raw data for the T1 & T2 mapping sequences.
* `notebooks`:	contains all intermediate sequence source code for the *Pulseq sequence hands-on* lecture, and T1 & T2 mapping sequence source code for the *Pulseq for mapping* lecture.
* `slides`:	contains slides of all presentations in the PDF format.
