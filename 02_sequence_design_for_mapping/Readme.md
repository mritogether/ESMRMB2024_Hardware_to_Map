## Necessary technical preparation steps
* Provided hands-on exercises and pulse sequence code snippets are in Python programming language.
* The hands-on exercises will be based on running Python code in Notebooks within Google Colab, therefore, no additional software is required.    
* A **Google account** and a **laptop or tablet connected to the Internet** are required to run Notebooks in Google Colab.

## Organization of this repository
This folder contains all course materials, including
* hands-on exercises and the corresponding solutions as Python notebooks,
* example raw data acquired with the T1/T2 mapping sequences,
* and slides of the presentations.

## Directory description
* `data`: contains example raw data for the T1 & T2 mapping sequences.
* `notebooks`:	contains all intermediate sequence source codes for the *Pulseq sequence hands-on* lecture, and T1 & T2 mapping sequence source codes for *Pulseq for mapping* lecture.
* `slides`:	this directory will contain slides of all presentations.
